A better victory screen that places the focus on automation, and not combat.

You can view the victory screen at any time by typing the command `/show-victory-screen`.

# Compatibility

Any mods that change the game's victory condition will require explicit compatibility. The following overhaul mods is currently compatible (that I know of):

- [Ultracube: Age of Cube](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Ultracube)
- [Nullius](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/nullius)

**Note to mod developers:** If you want to add compatibility to your mod you can read how to [here](https://github.com/heinwessels/factorio-better-victory-screen/blob/main/mod-page/compatibility.md). 

# Caveats:
- Some statistics (like "distance walked") will only be accurate if mod is added at the start of a save file.
- Finish button is not functional due to modding API limitations.
